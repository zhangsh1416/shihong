# Comprehensive Guide to Loss Functions in Deep Learning

Loss functions are a fundamental aspect of training neural networks, guiding the optimization process to improve model performance. They measure the difference between predicted outputs and actual target values, with the objective of minimizing this difference. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of loss functions used across various deep learning tasks.

## Introduction to Loss Functions

In deep learning, the loss function, also known as the cost function or objective function, quantifies the model's prediction error. It plays a crucial role in training neural networks by providing a scalar value that the optimization algorithm seeks to minimize. The choice of loss function significantly impacts the training dynamics and final performance of the model.

## Loss Functions for Different Tasks

### Regression Tasks

#### <span style="color: #2980B9;">**Mean Squared Error (MSE)** / **L2 Loss**</span>
- **Description**: Measures the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
- **Formula**: 
  <p align="center" style="color: #2980B9;">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\text{MSE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2" alt="MSE" style="color: #2980B9;" />
  </p>
- **L2 Loss**: The L2 loss is the sum of the squared differences, without averaging.
  <p align="center" style="color: #2980B9;">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?L2=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2" alt="L2 Loss" style="color: #2980B9;" />
  </p>
- **Use Case**: Predicting continuous values such as house prices or temperatures.
- **Advantages**: Penalizes larger errors more heavily, which can be beneficial when larger errors are particularly undesirable.
- **Disadvantages**: Sensitive to outliers, as squared differences can become very large.

- **Advantages**: Probabilistic interpretation and well-suited for imbalanced datasets.
- **Disadvantages**: Can be sensitive to incorrect predictions when probabilities are close to 0 or 1.

#### <span style="color: #27AE60;">**Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE)**</span>
- **Description**: Measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability distribution over multiple classes.
- **Formula**: 
  <p align="center" style="color: #27AE60;">
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\text{CCE}=-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{k}y_{ij}\log(\hat{y}_{ij})" alt="CCE" style="color: #27AE60;" />
  </p>
- **Use Case**: Multi-class classification tasks such as digit recognition.
- **Advantages**: Handles multi-class problems effectively.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires one-hot encoded targets and can be sensitive to class imbalance.

#### <span style="color: #27AE60;">**Focal Loss**</span>
- **Description**: Focuses on hard-to-classify examples by reducing the relative loss for well-classified examples.
- **Formula**: 
  <p align="center" style="color: #27AE60;">
